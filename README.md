# VOLUMÃ©TRICO

Gets a sequence of images from a video and plays them in 3D. The video is converted into a 3D grid from its BnW equivalent's grayscale values. The contrast is modified. The user can play with it rotating it in space.

Seems like I can't play audio while the script is working. Something about a 5 second limit in the loading process. I don't know if it's something regarding my processing installation because I couldn't play video in 3D as well.
